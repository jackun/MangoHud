# Installation
- Arch linux: [PKGBUILD](https://github.com/flightlessmango/PKGBUILDS/blob/master/mangohud/PKGBUILD)

# Normal usage

To enable the MangoHud vulkan overlay layer, run :

`MANGOHUD=1 /path/to/my_vulkan_app`

Or alternatively, add `MANGOHUD=1` to your shell profile.

## MANGOHUD_CONFIG parameters

You can customize the hud by using the MANGOHUD_CONFIG environment variable while separating different options with a comma.

- `cpu_temp`  :  Displays current CPU temperature
- `gpu_temp`  :  Displays current GPU temperature
- `core_load` :  Displays current CPU load per core
- `font_size` :  Changes the default font size (default is 24)
- `width`     :  Set custom hud width
- `height`    :  Set custom hud height
- `position=x`:  Available values for `x` include `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, and `bottom-right`

Note: Width and Height are set automatically based on the font_size, but can be overridden.

Example: `MANGOHUD_CONFIG=cpu_temp,gpu_temp,position=top-right,height=500,font_size=32`

## Environment Variables
- `MANGO_OUTPUT` : Define name and location of the output file (Required for logging)
- `MANGOHUD_FONT`: Change default font (set location to .TTF/.OTF file )

## Keybindings
- `F2` : Toggle Logging
- `F12`: Toggle Hud

## MangoHud fps logging

When you toggle logging (using the keybind `F2`), a file is created with your chosen name + date/time stamp (using `MANGO_OUTPUT`).

This file can be uploaded to [Flightlessmango.com](https://flightlessmango.com/games/user_benchmarks) to create graphs automatically.
you can share the created page with others, just link it.

#### Multiple log files

It's possible to upload multiple files when using [Flightlessmango.com](https://flightlessmango.com/games/user_benchmarks). You can rename them to your preferred names and upload them in a batch.
These filenames will be used as the legend in the graph.
